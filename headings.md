# Headings in Markdown
In markdown, headings are created by using the # symbol followed by the heading text. The number of # symbols indicates the heading level, with one # symbol for the highest level heading and six # symbols for the lowest level heading.

The following are examples of Markdown headings:

This is the Markdown code:
---
`# Heading 1`

`## Heading 2`

`### Heading 3`

`#### Heading 4`
